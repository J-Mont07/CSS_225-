#Examples:
#
#This line evaluates to 90 because subtracting 10 from 100 gives you 90.
(100 - 10)

#This line evaluates to true because 100 is greater than 10.
(100 > 10)

#Worth 10 points each:

#This line will evaluate to 4 because it is adding 2 + 2.
print (2 + 2)

#This line will evaluate to 3.0 because it is 12 is being divided by 4.
print (12/4)

#This line evaluates to 0 because 8 modulo 2 is evenly didable. 
print (8%2)

#This line evaluates to 696 because of Order Operation first mutiples 100 by 7, and then it subtracts 4.
print (100*7-4)

#This line evaluates to 300 because of Order of Operartion. First subtract 7-4,which gives you 3. Then multiplty by 100.
print (100*(7-4))

#This line evaluates to 5 because of Order of operation. Add 8 and 9. Find the modulo of 80 with 17. And then subtract by 5. 
print (80%(8+9)-7)

#This line evaluates to True. 10 is greater than 7.
print (10 > 7)

#This line evaluates to True. 20 is less than equall too 20.
print (20 <= 20)

#This line evaluates to False. 20 is not equal to 30. 10 does not equal 7.
print (20 != 30 and 10 == 7)

#This line evaluates to True because 100 > 100 is false. 7%2 == 1 which is True.
print (100 > 98+2 or 7%2 == 1)



#BONUS: Modify this code to display the result of each line to the user through the console when this file is run
#       (there are several ways to do this).
